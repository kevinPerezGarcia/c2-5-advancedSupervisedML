Description:

The Six Cities Study of Air Pollution and Health was a
longitudinal study designed to characterize lung growth as 
measured by changes in pulmonary function in children and 
adolescents, and the factors that influence lung function growth. 
A cohort of 13,379 children born on or after 1967 was enrolled 
in six communities across the U.S.: Watertown (Massachusetts), 
Kingston and Harriman (Tennessee), a section of St. Louis (Missouri), 
Steubenville (Ohio), Portage (Wisconsin), and Topeka (Kansas). 
Most children were enrolled in the first or second 
grade (between the ages of six and seven) and measurements of study
participants were obtained annually until graduation from high
school or loss to follow-up. At each annual examination,
spirometry, the measurement of pulmonary function, was performed
and a respiratory health questionnaire was completed by a parent
or guardian.

The dataset contains a subset of the pulmonary function data collected 
in the Six Cities Study. The data consist of all measurements of FEV1, 
height and age obtained from a randomly selected subset of the female
participants living in Topeka, Kansas. The random sample consists
of 300 girls, with a minimum of one and a maximum of twelve
observations over time.
