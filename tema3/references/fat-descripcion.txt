Description:

The data are from a prospective study on body fat accretion in a cohort of 
162 girls from the MIT Growth and Development Study. The study examined changes
in percent body fat before and after menarche. The data represent a subset of 
the study materials and should not be used to draw substantive conclusions.

At the start of the study, all of the girls were pre-menarcheal and non-obese, 
as determined by a triceps skinfold thickness less than the 85th percentile. 
All girls were followed over time according to a schedule of annual measurements
until four years after menarche. The final measurement was scheduled on the 
fourth anniversary of their reported date of menarche.  At each examination, 
a measure of body fatness was obtained based on bioelectric impedance analysis 
and a measure of percent body fat (%BF) was derived. In this data set there are
a total of 1049 individual percent body fat measurements, with an average of 6.4
measurements per subject. The numbers of measurements per subject pre- and post-menarche 
are approximately equal.

Note: Time is coded as time since menarche and can be positive or negative. 
Although the measurement protocol is the same for all girls and the study 
design is balanced if the timing of measurement is defined as the time since 
the baseline measurement, it is inherently unbalanced when the timing of
measurements is defined as the time since a girl experienced
menarche.
